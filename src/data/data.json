At first, the ecosystem enables the company to sell more existing products to more customers.

Companies in this archetype derive value from earning improved revenue from core products and services and merchant-funded platform usage. At first, the ecosystem enables the company to sell more existing products to more customers. Once the ecosystem is established, and reaches the desired scale, the company can provide more extensive service offerings. It can also use its platform to attract merchants, which it can charge for using it, creating more value.",

At first, the ecosystem enables the company to sell more existing products to more customers. Once the ecosystem is established, and reaches the desired scale, the company can provide more extensive service offerings. It can also use its platform to attract merchants, which it can charge for using it, creating more value.",

We've also taken the opportunity to build new data capabilities for much broader enterprise benefit, including real time data streaming, API gateways, and a new cloud data platform. We've also implemented a federated identity management solution that will progressively extend to manage the identity and consent process for all of our customer and staff applications. And with the added complexity of multiple core banking systems across our brands, our broader transformation agenda is actively simplifying and modernising the underlying core banking platforms.”",

At first, the ecosystem enables the company to sell more existing products to more customers. Once the ecosystem is established, and reaches the desired scale, the company can provide more extensive service offerings.
