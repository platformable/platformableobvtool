We've also implemented a federated identity management solution that will progressively extend to manage the identity and consent process for all of our customer and staff applications.

The marketplace also includes services from VICOM Ltd, the largest vehicle inspection and technical testing company in Singapore. - Since its launch in March this year, DBS Electricity Marketplace, which allows consumers to seamlessly switch to new electricity retailers iSwitch and Keppel Electric, has attracted some 190,000 unique visitors – almost double of the 108,000 eligible Jurong households. This indicates deep interest from consumers in the potential switching of electricity providers and bodes well for the electricity liberalisation which will happen by the end of the year. DBS looks forward to introducing more electricity retailers to the marketplace then."
